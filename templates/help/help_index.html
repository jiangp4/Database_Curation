<h2>Curation Workflow</h2>

<p>
The curation procedure has three stages: identification of relevant datasets, annotation of sample information, and automatic data processing. Before any curation work, please get into main menu <a href="/project/project_select/">PROJECT -> SELECT</a> to make the project selection.
</p>
<ol>
	<li><strong>Stage One</strong>: <a href="/help/help_dataset/">Identify relevant datasets</a>. Curators should identify datasets related to a specific study topic by reading the title, summary, design sections, and sample meta-information tables.</li> 
	
	<li><strong>Stage Two</strong>: <a href="/help/help_sample/">Annotate sample conditions</a>. For each identified relevant dataset, the curators should interpret the sample meta information and create standardized columns that automatic programs can analyze.</li>
	<li><strong>Stage Three</strong>: <a href="/help/help_download/">Download and process data</a>. Curators should design an automatic program to analyze data based on annotations from previous steps without further human interventions. (If not, please redesign the curation scheme.)</li>
</ol>
